# Airline-Project

Welcome to our powerful and user-friendly airline reservation system! Developed as a GUI desktop application using Java, Java Swing, SQL, and MySQL, our system provides a seamless and efficient booking experience for both travelers and airline administrators.

With our application, we have incorporated an admin section that offers complete control and access over the system. Administrators have the authority to manage various functionalities within the application, ensuring smooth operations and exceptional user support.

One of the key features of our system is the ability to add new customers to the database. Administrators can securely input and store customer information, enabling efficient management of passenger data. This functionality streamlines the booking process, making it quick and hassle-free for both administrators and travelers.

Searching for customers based on specific criteria is made effortless through our application. Administrators can easily retrieve customer details, providing quick and accurate responses to inquiries or making necessary updates as required.

The ticket booking feature within our system simplifies the process for travelers. Users can search for available flights based on criteria such as departure location, destination, and date. The application presents a comprehensive list of available flights, along with essential details, enabling travelers to make informed decisions. Once a suitable flight is selected, booking the ticket becomes a seamless experience.

Our application seamlessly integrates with the backend database through SQL. This integration ensures real-time synchronization, providing accurate updates on seat availability, reservations, and customer details. By utilizing SQL and MySQL, we have established a secure and efficient connection between the frontend and backend, facilitating smooth data retrieval and manipulation.

To enhance user convenience, our system includes a ticket viewing feature. Travelers can effortlessly access their booked tickets, allowing them to stay informed about flight information, seat numbers, and fare details. This feature ensures travelers have easy access to their booking details and enables them to make any necessary changes or updates when needed.

Additionally, our application provides an administrative section within the GUI, granting authorized personnel the ability to manage user inquiries, handle ticket cancellations or modifications, and perform other administrative tasks efficiently.

In conclusion, our airline reservation system is a comprehensive and user-friendly application built using Java, Java Swing, SQL, and MySQL. The integration of these technologies enables seamless connectivity between the frontend and backend, resulting in a smooth booking experience for both travelers and administrators. With features such as customer management, ticket booking, and administrative functionalities, our system empowers airlines to streamline their operations and provide exceptional service to their customers.
